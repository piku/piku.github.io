But possible future directions are likely to take something like suture and port this across (or just use Caddy), doing away with <code>uwsgi</code> altogether.</p> <p>Go also (at the time) did not have a way to vendor dependencies that we were comfortable with, and that is also why Go support fell behind. Hopefully that will change soon.</p> <p>Q: Does it run under Python 3?</p> <p>A: Right now, it only runs on Python 3, even though it can deploy apps written in both major versions. It began its development using 2.7 and using<code>click</code> for abstracting the simpler stuff, and we eventually switched over to 3.5 once it was supported in Debian Stretch and Raspbian since we wanted to make installing it on the Raspberry Pi as simple as possible.</p> <p>Q: Why not just use <code>dokku</code>?</p> <p>A: We used <code>dokku</code> daily for many projects. But it relied on a number of <code>x64</code> containers that needed to be completely rebuilt for <code>ARM</code>, and when we decided we needed something like this (March 2016) that was barely possible - <code>docker</code> itself was not fully baked for <code>ARM</code> yet, and people were at the time just starting to get <code>herokuish</code> and <code>buildstep</code> to build on <code>ARM</code>.</p>"},{"location":"features.html","title":"Features","text":""},{"location":"features.html#workflow","title":"Workflow","text":"<p><code>piku</code> supports a Heroku-like workflow:</p> <ul> <li>Create a <code>git</code> SSH remote pointing to your <code>piku</code> server with the app name as repo name:   <code>git remote add piku piku@yourserver:appname</code>.</li> <li>Push your code: <code>git push piku master</code> (or if you want to push a different branch than the current one use <code>git push piku release-branch-name</code>).</li> <li><code>piku</code> determines the runtime and installs the dependencies for your app (building whatever's required).</li> <li>For Python, it segregates each app's dependencies into a <code>virtualenv</code>.</li> <li>For Go, it defines a separate <code>GOPATH</code> for each app.</li> <li>For Node, it installs whatever is in <code>package.json</code> into <code>node_modules</code>.</li> <li>For Java, it builds your app depending on either <code>pom.xml</code> or <code>build.gradle</code> file.</li> <li>For Clojure, it can use either <code>leiningen</code> or the Clojure CLI and a <code>deps.edn</code> file.</li> <li>For Ruby, it does <code>bundle install</code> of your gems in an isolated folder.</li> <li>It then looks at a <code>Procfile</code> and starts the relevant workers using <code>uwsgi</code> as a generic process manager.</li> <li>You can optionally also specify a <code>release</code> worker which is run once when the app is deployed.</li> <li>You can then remotely change application settings (<code>config:set</code>) or scale up/down worker processes (<code>ps:scale</code>).</li> <li>You can also bake application and <code>nginx</code> settings into an <code>ENV</code> configuration file.</li> </ul> <p>You can also deploy a <code>gh-pages</code> style static site using a <code>static</code> worker type, with the root path as the argument, and run a <code>release</code> task to do some processing on the server after <code>git push</code>.</p>"},{"location":"features.html#virtual-hosts-and-ssl","title":"Virtual Hosts and SSL","text":"<p><code>piku</code> has full virtual host support - i.e., you can host multiple apps on the same VPS and use DNS aliases to access them via different hostnames. </p> <p><code>piku</code>  will also set up either a private certificate or obtain one via Let's Encrypt to enable SSL.</p> <p>If you are on a LAN and are accessing <code>piku</code> from macOS/iOS/Linux clients, you can try using <code>piku/avahi-aliases</code> to announce different hosts for the same IP address via Avahi/mDNS/Bonjour.</p>"},{"location":"features.html#caching-and-static-paths","title":"Caching and Static Paths","text":"<p>Besides static sites, <code>piku</code> also supports directly mapping specific URL prefixes to filesystem paths (to serve static assets) or caching back-end responses (to remove load from applications).</p> <p>These features are configured by setting appropriate values in the <code>ENV</code> file.</p>"},{"location":"features.html#supported-platforms","title":"Supported Platforms","text":"<p><code>piku</code> is intended to work in any POSIX-like environment where you have Python, <code>nginx</code>, <code>uwsgi</code> and <code>ssh</code>: it has been deployed on Linux, FreeBSD, [Cygwin][cygwin] and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux][wsl].</p> <p>As a baseline, it began its development on an original 256MB Rasbperry Pi Model B, and still runs reliably on it.</p> <p>But its main use is as a micro-PaaS to run applications on cloud servers with both Intel and ARM CPUs, with either Debian or Ubuntu Linux as target platforms.</p>"},{"location":"features.html#supported-runtimes","title":"Supported Runtimes","text":"<p><code>piku</code> currently supports apps written in Python, Node, Clojure, Java and a few other languages (like Go) in the works.</p> <p>But as a general rule, if it can be invoked from a shell, it can be run inside <code>piku</code>.</p>"},{"location":"manage.html","title":"Manage","text":""},{"location":"manage.html#managing-your-piku-apps","title":"Managing your Piku apps","text":"<p>To make life easier you can also install the <code>piku</code> helper into your path (e.g. <code>~/bin</code>):</p> <pre><code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piku/piku/master/piku &gt;
